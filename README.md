# Landing-Page

## Description

This webpage was built for an up and coming business to collect customer data. It provides a great template to continue to build the website as the company grows. While building this website I learned a lot about HTML and CSS. I learned how to identify classes in HTML so I can apply style to them in CSS. I learned how to build and style a form, and I got more familiar with visualizing the CSS box model as it presents on a page.

## Usage

The page features a fixed navigation bar at the top of the page and it contains links to my personal Github, my personal Github repositories, and the contact link directs you to the form at the bottom of the page. The contact form has a place to enter name and email, as well as a working send button.
